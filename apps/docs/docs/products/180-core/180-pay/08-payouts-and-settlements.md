# Payouts, Settlements & Ledger

180 Pay features an automated double-entry ledger that tracks all gross transaction volume, 1.5% platform fees, and pending settlements.

    Collected[Gross Customer Payments] --> NetAfterSplit[Gross Volume - 1.5% Fee]
    NetAfterSplit --> Clearing[T+1 Clearing Cycle]
    Clearing --> Withdrawable[Available Withdrawable Balance]
    Withdrawable --> Payout[Instant UPI / Bank Account Transfer]
```

## 1. Settlement Timeline

- **T+0 (Transaction Day)**: Funds captured from customers enter `Pending Settlements`.
- **T+1 (Clearing Day)**: After gateway settlement verification, funds are cleared into your project's `Withdrawable Balance`.
- **Payout Disbursement**: Once cleared, developers can withdraw their balance directly to their registered bank account or UPI ID.

## 2. Registering Settlement Bank Details
